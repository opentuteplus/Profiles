# Profiles

Profiles is built on the solid foundation of the [BuddyPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/). 
We decided to fork this project to provide a more generic Profiles plugin that could be easily extended for more specific use-cases.

* It adds profile for each user.
* It adds member directory, where we can search members.
* It can be extended to add more features on profile page.

Note: 
Not to confuse with it. It is not a Alternative to BuddyPress. It is different plugin for differnt purpose. It is not going to be Social/Membership plugin. As a social plugin, BuddyPress is the best one, We love to use it. It is just a simple light weight plugin for adding member profile to your website. Nothing less,Nothing more. :)
